## the story of homo sapiens and dinosaurous :)
About 66 million years ago, before the age of humans, homo sapiens. before the stone age or the ice age, lived the dinosaurs. *The Mesozoic Age.* Dinosaurs littered the earth, the world was a scary place to be in and the screechs of prey caught by dinosaurs rang everywhere. Nowhere was safe for humans and even if humans did live in that era, they must have died a gruesome death. During the cruel Mesozoic Era, lived the *Dinosaurous*. The Dinosaurous was a special dinosaur, or half-blood dinosaur (in a sense). This was for the fact that the Dinosaurous had the upper half of a human(homo sapiens then), but the lower body of the usual Tyrannosaurus Rex. It was rumoured that the Dinosaurous was made by the unusual hybrid of the first humans who lived and the ferocious T-Rex. This made the Dinosaurous the scariest predator of the Mesozoic Age and at the top of the food chain with its strong body and quick wits, posessing both brains and braun. 

Nearing the end of the Mesozoic age where the dinosaurs were supposedly extinct, only the Dinosaurous survived. Though in old age, he was just as agile as before, with clever brains of the humans his mum gifted him. For years, he lived in a cave of his own, unknown to the world. Life was never the same again for the Dinosaurous for most of his prey had gone extinct thanks to humans. There were a few lucky instances when humans passed his cave but none of them lived to tell the tale with their cries for help gone silent.
